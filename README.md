# Simulation of patients with liver disorders

This repo contains code to generate synthetic patients with liver disorders based on 
the Bayesian network implemented by [1] and available in <code>bnlearn R </code> package [2].

The dataset can be found  here https://zenodo.org/record/6726768#.Y1vxci8Rpz8.

The dataset has been used to assess the performance of XAI methods in [Parimbelli et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2022.102471)
